These are the scripts for the sudoroom hackerspace's raspberry pi doorputer.

The doorputer has one GPIO pin hooked up to a relay that unlocks the door
when the GPIO pin is set to logic high.

The doorputer has a usb wifi adapter which is running as master (access point).

The DNS daemon and web daemon together make a captive web page appear when
e.g. a smartphone connects to the access point.

The DNS daemon resolves all DNS requests to the doorputer's IP.

The web daemon is a simple web app that will unlock the door when the
right password is entered.

There is no encryption. Everything is plaintext. Replay attacks are easy.

The rfid daemon waits for input from the rfid reader (which acts as a serial
device, outputting the ID number of RFID tags within proximity of the reader)
and if the ID is in a hardcoded list of accepted IDs, then it runs the
opendoor.py script, which unlocks the door for a few seconds.

The .py scripts do the work.
The non-.py scripts are just bash scripts that go in /etc/init.d.
